# Semi-analytical-model-for-disordered-photonic-crystals
This Mathematica code models the effect of disorder on the optical response of photonic crystals.
This semi-analytical model combines the information generated from FDTD simulations on predicted reflectance spectral shape with the predicted peak locations determined from Braggâ€™s Law.

This code has been used to understand the role of disorder in biological photonic crystals (see CITATION.txt).
